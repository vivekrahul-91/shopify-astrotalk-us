If it’s new, you can soak it in milk and honey for a few minutes. This isn’t just cleansing, it’s preparing the bead to connect with your energy.</p><p>Next, hold it in your right hand and chant “Om Namah Shivaya” 108 times. Do it with focus and love, it’s how you align the Rudraksha with your intention. Mondays are great, or Shivratri if you want to go deeper. Try wearing it early in the morning, between 6–8 AM.</p><p>When you finally wear it, take a quiet moment. Close your eyes, chant your mantra, and set your intention for peace, strength, clarity, whatever your heart needs. Just remember to treat it with love. Avoid soaps or perfumes, and clean it regularly. It’s not just a bead, it’s your spiritual companion.</p>",
